Dream Sounds

For Ubuntu users:

Ubuntu 7.10: Make sure the esound is installed in Synaptic and ESD enabled into the audio preferences dialog box.

On ubuntu 8.04 dont use esound but pulse audio and pulseaudio-esound-compat
(Check it in Synaptic) 

Open the Terminal    < sudo nautilus >

Navigate to File system  usr/share/sounds, (backup the ubuntu original sounds if you think you will use them in the future)
copy and paste the .wav files.

Select the sounds in the sounds audio preferences.

Reboot.

I have made 2 different end sounds, one is the full (Dream End.ogg) and one mixed shorter (shutdown.ogg).
You will need to rename Dream End.wav into shutdown.wav to make it work properly with the system.

Unfortunately for an unknown reason (probably a bug) the shutdown sound wont work on pulse audio since the new release 8.04. Probably because the sytem shuts the audio daemon too fast, I strongly hope it will be fixed with the next release.



Hope you will enjoy them.
